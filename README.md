## Description
A generative art piece that combines visual movement with procedural audio. The snake explores its environment autonomously, creating sounds based on its movement patterns, curvature, and interactions with the space. As it moves, it exhibits emergent behaviors and creates dynamic soundscapes.

## Features
- Autonomous snake movement with edge exploration
- Generative audio based on movement
- Interactive sound controls
- Recording capability
- Evolution of complexity over time
- Dynamic edge interaction
- Ambient sound generation
- Mouse-based interaction

## Controls
- SPACE: Toggle sound on/off
- R: Start recording
- S: Stop recording
- Mouse: Influence field

## Technical Stack
- Built with p5.js
- Real-time audio synthesis
- Procedural animation
- WebM recording capabilities
