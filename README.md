# Gradient Descent

An interactive audiovisual experience that explores the metaphor of gradient descent through the movement of a snake-like entity. The snake follows gradient fields while producing dynamic, movement-based sounds.

## Overview

This project combines visual art, sound design, and algorithmic movement to create an organic, evolving experience. The snake entity moves through a dynamic gradient field, creating an emergent behavior that mimics both natural movement and optimization algorithms.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movement**: Snake follows gradient fields and exhibits various behaviors:
  - Gradient-based exploration
  - Edge investigation with sniffing behavior
  - Resting states
  - Organic movement patterns

- **Interactive Sound Design**:
  - Movement-responsive audio
  - Harmonic sound generation
  - Environmental ambience
  - Sniffing sound effects
  - Adjustable sound intensity

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Smooth, organic animation
  - Dynamic color changes
  - Responsive movement trails
  - Gradient field influence

## Controls

- **SPACE**: Toggle sound on/off
- **R**: Start recording
- **S**: Stop recording
- **Mouse**: Direct interaction with the snake

## Technical Details

Built using:
- p5.js for graphics and animation
- p5.sound.js for audio synthesis
- Perlin noise for organic movement
- WebAudio API for sound processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Enable audio for the full experience

## Recording Feature

The project includes a built-in recording capability:
1. Press 'R' to start recording
2. Press 'S' to stop and save
3. Recording will be saved as a WebM file
4. Use HandBrake to convert to other formats if needed
