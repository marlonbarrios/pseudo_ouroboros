# Squiggle in Gradient Descent

![Snake Soundscape](squiggle.png)

An interactive audiovisual experience where a luminous snake-like form explores its environment and itself through organic movement and generative sound. The creature exhibits emergent behaviors, creating dynamic soundscapes and visual responses as it investigates its surroundings and its own form.

## Description
A generative art piece that combines visual movement with procedural audio synthesis. The snake explores its environment autonomously while creating a rich soundscape through multiple audio layers:

- Ambient drone sounds that evolve with the snake's movement
- Echolocation-like clicks when exploring edges
- Movement-based harmonic sounds
- Sniffing sounds during environmental exploration
- Human-like vocalizations during self-exploration
- Soft pushing sounds during self-nudging
- Propagating glow effects during interactions

## Features
- Autonomous snake movement with edge exploration
- Self-exploration behavior
- Self-nudging interaction
- Generative audio based on movement
- Interactive sound controls
- Recording capability
- Evolution of complexity over time
- Dynamic edge interaction
- Ambient sound generation
- Mouse-based interaction
- Body-wide luminescence
- Organic sound synthesis

## Sound Design
The audio experience consists of multiple layers:
- **Base Drone**: Evolving ambient sound that responds to position and movement
- **Movement Harmonics**: Dynamic tones based on speed and curvature
- **Edge Clicks**: Echolocation-style sounds when near boundaries
- **Exploration Sounds**: Sniffing sounds during environmental investigation
- **Self-Exploration**: Human-like vocalizations with formant synthesis
- **Nudge Sounds**: Soft pushing sounds when interacting with itself
- **Spatial Audio**: Reverb and delay effects based on environment
- **Evolution**: Sound complexity increases over time

## Visual Effects
- Dynamic body glow that propagates along segments
- Intensity variation based on interaction type
- Edge proximity illumination
- Self-exploration highlighting
- Organic light diffusion
- Fading movement trail
- Wet-like trace effects

## Controls
- SPACE: Toggle sound on/off
- R: Start recording
- S: Stop recording
- Mouse: Influence field

## Technical Stack
- Built with p5.js
- Real-time audio synthesis
- Procedural animation
- WebM recording capabilities
