# Squiggle in Gradient Descent
## The Genesis of Interest (4.0)

A generative artwork exploring the concept of gradient descent through an autonomous organism's behavior. Like a neural network finding optimal paths, the organism continuously seeks and adapts to its environment, creating an emergent choreography of movement, sound, and light.

The organism uses principles similar to gradient descent algorithms: it explores its space, responds to environmental feedback, and adjusts its behavior based on various parameters including edge proximity, movement history, and user interaction. This creates a dynamic system where the organism appears to learn and adapt to its environment.

The piece responds to the actual time of day, creating different behaviors and visual states throughout a 24-hour cycle, much like biological circadian rhythms.
