# Squiggle in Gradient Descent
## The Genesis of Interest (4.0)

A generative and interactive audiovisual experience where a snake-like form explores its environment with organic movement and generative sound. The organism autonomously navigates a dynamic space, creating evolving soundscapes based on its movement, curvature, and interactions.
