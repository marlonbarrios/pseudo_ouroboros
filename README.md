## Description
Snake Soundscape is an interactive art piece that combines visual movement with procedural audio. The snake explores its environment autonomously, creating sounds based on its movement patterns, curvature, and interactions with the space. Its head glows more intensely when near edges or during active exploration, creating a mesmerizing visual and auditory experience.

## Features
- Organic autonomous movement with edge awareness
- Dynamic glowing effects responding to movement and environment
- Generative audio based on snake's behavior
- Interactive sound controls
- Recording capability
- Evolution of complexity over time
- Natural resting behaviors
- Responsive edge exploration
- Ambient drone sounds
- Visual feedback through glowing effects

## Controls
- SPACE: Toggle sound on/off
- R: Start recording
- S: Stop recording
- Mouse: Influence snake's behavior
- The snake will autonomously:
  - Explore edges with glowing intensity
  - Rest periodically
  - Respond to environmental boundaries
  - Create dynamic soundscapes

## Technical Details
The project uses:
- p5.js for graphics and audio synthesis
- Perlin noise for organic movement
- Dynamic audio generation
- Physics-based movement simulation
- Evolutionary behavior patterns
- WebM recording capabilities
